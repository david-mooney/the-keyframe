Testing some of the formatting options that I can avail of in markdown.

### List

- Well uncritical so misled
- Goodness much until that fluid owl

### Code

```javascript
const myString = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";

const reverse = (text) => {
  return text.split('').reverse.join();
};

reverse(myString);
```

**bold** *italic*

> This is a very nice quote
